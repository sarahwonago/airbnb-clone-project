- `is_host`: Boolean flag to determine if the user is a host.

### 2. Properties
Listings created by hosts for rental.
- `id`: Unique identifier for each property.
- `title`: Name/title of the property.
- `description`: Detailed information about the property.
- `location`: Geographical location of the property.
- `host_id`: Foreign key referencing the User who owns the property.

### 3. Bookings
Records of reservations made by users for properties.
- `id`: Unique identifier for each booking.
- `property_id`: Foreign key referencing the Property.
- `user_id`: Foreign key referencing the User (guest).
- `check_in`: Start date of the booking.
- `check_out`: End date of the booking.

### 4. Reviews
Feedback and ratings submitted by guests.
- `id`: Unique identifier for each review.
- `user_id`: Foreign key referencing the User who wrote the review.
- `property_id`: Foreign key referencing the Property being reviewed.
- `rating`: Numerical rating (e.g., 1–5).
- `comment`: Text content of the review.

### 5. Payments
Handles financial transactions associated with bookings.
- `id`: Unique identifier for each payment.
- `booking_id`: Foreign key referencing the Booking.
- `amount`: Total amount paid.
- `payment_status`: Enum indicating status (e.g., pending, completed).
- `payment_date`: Timestamp of when the payment was processed.

### Entity Relationships

- A **User** can list multiple **Properties** (1-to-many).
- A **Property** can have multiple **Bookings** (1-to-many).
- A **Booking** belongs to one **Property** and one **User** (many-to-1).
- A **Property** can receive multiple **Reviews** (1-to-many).
- A **Review** is written by a **User** for a **Property** (many-to-1).
- A **Booking** has one associated **Payment** (1-to-1).


## Feature Breakdown
1. API Documentation
OpenAPI Standard: The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard to ensure clarity and ease of integration.

2. User Authentication
Endpoints: /users/, /users/{user_id}/
Features: Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.
3. Property Management
Endpoints: /properties/, /properties/{property_id}/
Features: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.
4. Booking System
Endpoints: /bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}/
Features: Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.
5. Payment Processing
Endpoints: /payments/
Features: Handle payment transactions related to bookings.
6. Review System
Endpoints: /reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}/
Features: Post and manage reviews for properties.
7. Database Optimizations
Indexing: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
Caching: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.

## API Security

Securing the backend APIs of the Airbnb Clone project is critical to protect user data, ensure safe transactions, and prevent unauthorized access. Below are the key security measures that will be implemented:

### Key Security Measures

#### 1. Authentication
- **Description**: Verifies the identity of users before granting access to protected resources.
- **Implementation**: Uses token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) for secure and stateless user sessions.
- **Importance**: Prevents unauthorized access and ensures only registered users can interact with their own data.

#### 2. Authorization
- **Description**: Determines whether an authenticated user has permission to perform a specific action.
- **Implementation**: Role-based access control (RBAC) to distinguish between hosts and guests.
- **Importance**: Ensures that users can only perform actions they are permitted to, such as only allowing hosts to create properties.

#### 3. Rate Limiting
- **Description**: Limits the number of API requests a user or IP can make in a certain period.
- **Implementation**: Middleware to monitor and restrict excessive usage (e.g., using Django Ratelimit or third-party packages).
- **Importance**: Protects against brute force attacks and abuse of public endpoints.

#### 4. Data Validation & Sanitization
- **Description**: Ensures all incoming data is safe and well-formed.
- **Implementation**: Input validation at both the serializer and view level.
- **Importance**: Prevents injection attacks and maintains data integrity.

#### 5. HTTPS Enforcement
- **Description**: Encrypts all data transmitted between clients and the server.
- **Implementation**: Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS in production environments.
- **Importance**: Protects sensitive data from being intercepted over the network.

### Why API Security is Crucial

- **User Data Protection**: Prevents unauthorized access to personal information such as emails, passwords, and booking history.
- **Secure Payments**: Ensures financial transactions and payment details are encrypted and verified.
- **Trust & Reliability**: Builds user confidence in the platform by ensuring data is handled securely.
- **System Integrity**: Prevents malicious users from disrupting services or accessing administrative features.


## CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?

**CI/CD** stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment/Delivery**. It is a software development practice that automates the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes. CI/CD helps streamline development workflows, reduce errors in production, and deliver new features faster and more reliably.

### Why It’s Important for This Project

- **Automated Testing**: Ensures every code change passes tests before it’s merged, maintaining code quality.
- **Faster Deployment**: Automates deployment to development, staging, or production environments.
- **Team Collaboration**: Allows multiple developers to work concurrently while minimizing conflicts and integration issues.
- **Early Bug Detection**: Catches issues early in the development cycle through continuous feedback.
- **Consistent Environments**: Guarantees code runs the same way locally and in production via containerization.

### Tools Used

- **GitHub Actions**: Automates workflows such as running tests, linting code, and deploying applications after each push or pull request.
- **Docker**: Containerizes the application for consistent development and production environments.
- **Docker Compose**: Used to manage multi-container setups for services like the backend, database, and caching layer.
- **PostgreSQL**: Ensures database availability for integration testing.
- **AWS** *(optional)*: Can be used for automated deployment depending on project needs.

The CI/CD pipeline ensures a reliable and efficient development lifecycle, making it easier to scale and maintain the Airbnb Clone project as it grows.
